# Geo-Reference Systems
## 2D coordinate systems
1. Polar coordinates
- Geomatics (compass) - clockwise from y
- Mathematics - anticlockwise from x
- Linear units as for rectangular coordinates
- Angular units
    - Degrees, minutes and seconds (ddd° mm′ ss″)
    - Decimal degrees (ddd.dddd°)
    - Grads or gons (惯性导航): 360° = 400 gon

2. Some transformations used in geomatics
- Conformal, similarity or Helmert(x,y)
    - One scale, one rotation, two translations
    - Preserves angles (shape)
- Affine(scale1,scale2,x,y)
  - Two scales, one rotation, two translations, one shear
  - Preserves relative directions (parallel lines)

3. Conformal transformation : Need to solve the transformation parameters (a, b, c, d)
- Use control points
  - How many for a unique solution?
    - 2 pairs of known poins = 4 equations
  - What happens with redundant control?
    - l + v = B * delta
    - P23 residuals 残差 v
    - least-squares [最小二乘法](https://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/ila/least-squares.html)
    - reject points with errors
## 3D coordinate(X,Y,Z unit in length) systems
1. Main transformation is 3D conformal
   - One scale
   - **Three rotations** P34 rotation matrix M = M_Omega * M_Phi * M_Kappa
     - M_Omega: x 轴不动 逆时针旋转角度为正 hold x axis fixed
     - M_Phi: y ~
     - M_Kappa: Z ~
   - Three translations
## Geo-coordinate(Lat,Lon unit in angle) systems
1. Great and small circles
- Great circles - lontatitude
  - Intersection of a plane passing through the **centre of a sphere**
  - Shortest distance between two points on the surface of the sphere
- Small circles - latitude
  - Intersection of a plane passing through an other part of a sphere
- All circles have a pole

2. Longitude Latitude
- Longitude, λ
  - Angle in Equatorial plane
  - +ve East and – ve West from Prime Meridian
- Latitude, φ
  - Angle in meridional plane
  - +ve North and – ve South from the Equator 赤道
  
3. The physical Earth
- Difficult to accurately assign geometric parameters to describe its shape
