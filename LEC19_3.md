# Geo-Reference Systems
## 2D coordinate systems
1. Polar coordinates
- Geomatics (compass) - clockwise from y
- Mathematics - anticlockwise from x
- Linear units as for rectangular coordinates
- Angular units
    - Degrees, minutes and seconds (ddd° mm′ ss″)
    - Decimal degrees (ddd.dddd°)
    - Grads or gons (惯性导航): 360° = 400 gon

2. Some transformations used in geomatics
- Conformal, similarity or Helmert(x,y)
    - One scale, one rotation, two translations
    - Preserves angles (shape)
- Affine(scale1,scale2,x,y)
  - Two scales, one rotation, two translations, one shear
  - Preserves relative directions (parallel lines)

3. Conformal transformation : Need to solve the transformation parameters (a, b, c, d)
- Use control points
  - How many for a unique solution?
    - 2 pairs of known poins = 4 equations
  - What happens with redundant control?
    - l + v = B * delta
    - P23 residuals 残差 v
    - least-squares [最小二乘法](https://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/ila/least-squares.html)
    - reject points with errors
## 3D coordinate(X,Y,Z unit in length) systems
1. Main transformation is 3D conformal
   - One scale
   - **Three rotations** P34 rotation matrix M = M_Omega * M_Phi * M_Kappa
     - M_Omega: x 轴不动 逆时针旋转角度为正 hold x axis fixed
     - M_Phi: y ~
     - M_Kappa: Z ~
   - Three translations
## Geo-coordinate(Lat,Lon unit in angle) systems
1. Great and small circles
- Great circles - lontatitude
  - Intersection of a plane passing through the **centre of a sphere**
  - Shortest distance between two points on the surface of the sphere
- Small circles - latitude
  - Intersection of a plane passing through an other part of a sphere
- All circles have a pole

2. Longitude Latitude
- Longitude, λ
  - Angle in Equatorial plane
  - +ve East and – ve West from Prime Meridian
- Latitude, φ
  - Angle in meridional plane
  - +ve North and – ve South from the Equator 赤道
  
3. The physical Earth
  - Difficult to accurately assign geometric parameters to describe its shape

4. reference ellipsoid : The chosen dimensions of the major and minor semi-axes depend on the purpose Most choices relate fitting a portion of an ellipsoid to a part of the Earth’s surface for mapping.
5. Why so much variation? The problem is gravity Varies from place to place Measurements of Earth’s shape made with instruments aligned with gravity. (Unit = gal = 10 mm sec-2, Affects all survey measurements)
6. Equipotential surfaces（等势面） are those with same gravitational potential energy.The equipotential surface that represents mean sea level (MSL) is called the **Geoid(大地水准面)** This is an irregular surface that responds to variation in mass, M. Level surfaces(由国家确定) are other equipotential surfaces above and below the Geoid. 
  - plumb line : 1. : a line (as of cord) that has at one end a weight (such as a plumb bob) and is used especially to determine verticality. 2. : a line directed to the center of gravity of the earth : a vertical line.
  - orthometric height(H) : distance along the plumb line
7. Geoid undulation(N): GPS hieght based on the perfect ellipsoid, 大地水准面与数学上椭球体之间的高度差值，修正值 Geoid-Spheriod separation or Geoid undulation(N) 相互转换要用到
8. (see P-72-Lec1) h = H + N (约等于)
