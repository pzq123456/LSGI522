## 1. Present, analyze and compare the two (4 control points and control plus auto-tie points) bundle adjustment results.
    - (展示，分析和比较两个（4个控制点和控制加自动连接点）捆绑调整结果。)

## 2. Present at least two screen captures of 3D model that best illustrate the work you have done. Explain the positive and negative features of your photogrammetric products.
    - （提供至少两个最能说明您所做工作的3D模型的屏幕截图。解释您的摄影测量产品的优点和缺点。）

## 3. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this method (stereo photogrammetry) compared to other methods you know for generating data.
1. Pros:
    1. Rapid Data Collection & Cost-Effective for Large Areas: Photogrammetry can cover large areas quickly, making it efficient for projects requiring extensive data collection.When surveying large areas, photogrammetry can be more cost-effective than using total stations, which require more time and labor.
    2. Non-Contact Method: It allows for data collection without physical contact with the object or terrain, which is beneficial in sensitive environments.
    3. 3D Visualization: The method provides a rich 3D representation of the surveyed area, which can be useful for analysis and presentations.
2. Cons:
    1. Accuracy Limitations: While photogrammetry can provide good accuracy, it may not match the precision of total stations, especially in complex environments.
    2. Sensitivity to Environmental Conditions: The method can be sensitive to environmental factors such as lighting, weather, and terrain, which can affect the quality of the data.
    3. Processing Time & Equipment Requirements: Because of the large amount of data involved, photogrammetry processing can be time-consuming, requiring specialized software and hardware. It can be considered as a technologe-intensive method(e.g. the need for high-performance computers and software rather than low-tech tools like tape measures and levels).
