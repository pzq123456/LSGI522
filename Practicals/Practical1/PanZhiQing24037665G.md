## Three-point resection
1. From the known coordinates of A, B, and C calculate lengths a and c, and angle α at station B. 
    - c: 41.7350262608734
    - a: 6.963461782748601
    - alpha: 169-4-12
2. Subtract the sum of angles x, y, and α in figure ABCP from 360° to obtain the sum of angles A + C 
   A + C = 360° - (α + x + y) 
    - A + C: 65-15-31
3. Calculate angles A and C using the following: 
    - A: 22-49-42
    - C: 42-25-48
4. From angle A and azimuth AB, calculate azimuth AP in triangle ABP. Then solve for length AP using the law of sines, where 𝛼𝛼1 = 180° - A - x. Calculate the ∆E and ∆N of AP followed by the coordinates of P. 
    - AP: 32.62646401200535
    - azimuthAB: 12-24-10
    - azimuthAP: 35-13-52
    - deltaE: 26.65030422241778 deltaN: 18.82146218494358
    - **P: 836537.5433042224 818647.9924621849**
5. In the manner outlined in step 4, use triangle BCP to calculate the coordinates of P to obtain a 
check.
