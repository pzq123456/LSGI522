# Topic 3 Map Projections

## Questions from exams
### 1. Question 4 
1. Suggest a set of projection equations for parameters (r=, h=, k=, p=, ω= ), which could create an azimuthal projection with a property of equivalence  (2 marks) 

2. Create a table of values for r, h, k, p, ω at latitudes 0 , 30, 45, 60 , 90 (degree) and comment on the distortion  (2 marks)
  
## Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
- UTM is not a new ⁄ revised projection. It just uses the Transverse Mercator to generate a series of maps. UTM is often wrongly described as a projection.
- UTM “projects” the Earth (as sphere or ellipsoid) 60 times and creates 60 UTM Zones.
- Each UTM Zone is in fact a different projection using a different system of coordinates.
