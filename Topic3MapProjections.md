# Topic 3 Map Projections
## Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
- UTM is not a new ⁄ revised projection. It just uses the Transverse Mercator to generate a series of maps. UTM is often wrongly described as a projection.
- UTM “projects” the Earth (as sphere or ellipsoid) 60 times and creates 60 UTM Zones.
- Each UTM Zone is in fact a different projection using a different system of coordinates.
