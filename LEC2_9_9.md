## Accuracy and Precision
1. Accuracy (Accuracy is the degree of absence of error 与真值相关)
   - Error = Observation(known) - Truth(unknown, May be an adopted value, Measured by a highly reliable technique)
   - 3 types of errors
    - Gross errors (mistakes, big error) : Eliminate gross errors by care and technique
    - Systematic errors (bias, constant) : Identify, model and minimise effects of systematic errors
    - Random errors (left over, use stastics normal distribution) : Statistically analyse random errors

2. precision (Precision relates to reliability, 重复测量的可靠性)
   - Standard deviation 越小 precision 越大 但是与 Accuracy 不相关

3. special law of propagation of variances (σ2) [误差传播定律](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/误差传播) 对上式以标准差平方代替真误差

## Positioning techniques
1. Angles : An angle (θ) is measured between two points. Measurements made with a protractor. Each reading is a direction
   - When the direction is oriented it becomes a bearing (β).
   - When oriented to True North it becomes a azimuth (α).

2. Radiation 

3. Intersection 
   - 两个距离（两个圆）可以有两个交点， 三个距离（三个圆）若有交点则只会有一个。（与 GPS 测量相类似 unique solution）
   - 某一次一次读数没有意义，两次读数之差才是测量值
