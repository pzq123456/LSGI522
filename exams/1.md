# Topic 1 Geo-reference system, 2D and 3D coordinate systems

## Polar coordinates
1. Position of a point is described with respect to an origin in terms of a linear (r) and an angular (θ) measurement.
- Need
    - A reference direction
    - A defined direction of angular measurement
- Two systems
    - Geomatics (compass) - clockwise from y
    - Mathematics - anticlockwise from x

## Cartesian coordinate system
1. Coordinate transformations
- Conformal, similarity or Helmert : Preserves angles (shape)
  - One scale, one rotation, two translations
- Affine (Preserves relative directions (parallel lines)) : 
  - Two scales, one rotation, two translations, one shear

## 3D coordinate systems
1.Main transformation is 3D conformal (One scale ,Three rotations ,Three translations)
  - Scale and translation are straight forward, Rotations are complicated
    - Most common system is omega, phi, kappa +ve anticlockwise when viewed towards the origin
        - Omega (ω) – about the X axis
        - Phi (φ) – about the Y axis
        - Kappa (κ) – about the Z axis
 • Rotations follow right hand screw rule

## Geo-coordinate systems

1. Longitude and Latitude On the Earth
- Great circles include
    - Equator
    - Meridians of longitude
- Small circles include : Parallels of latitude
- Poles include : North Pole ,South Pole

- Longitude, λ, Angle in Equatorial plane (Prime Meridian)
  -  +ve East and – ve West from 
- Latitude, φ Angle in meridional plane (the Equator)
  - +ve North and – ve South from 

## Gravity Causes difficulty in measuring heights over large areas
1. Different height systems
   - Orthometric height (H) : Height measured along the local vertical
   - Ellipsoidal height (h) : Height measured along the normal to the ellipsoid
   - Dynamic height : Height  measured  with  respect  to  equipotential surfaces
   - Geoid height (N) : Height difference between the geoid and the ellipsoid

To answer **Question 4**, here are the explanations and markings for the requested heights:

---

### 1. **What heights do GPS, Leveling, Gravity, and Satellite Altimetry measure?**

- **GPS (Global Positioning System):**  
  GPS measures the **ellipsoidal height**, which is the vertical distance above the ellipsoid. The ellipsoid is a smooth, mathematical model of the Earth's shape.

- **Leveling (Orthometric Height):**  
  Leveling measures the **orthometric height**, which is the height above the geoid (mean sea level). It is influenced by gravity and is often the height shown on maps.

- **Gravity (Geoid Height):**  
  Gravity-based measurements determine the **geoid height** or the shape of the geoid. The geoid represents the Earth's mean sea level, where gravity is constant.

- **Satellite Altimetry:**  
  Satellite altimetry measures the **height of the ocean surface** relative to the reference ellipsoid. It is typically used for oceanographic applications.

### 2. **Marking Them on the Image (Figure 1):**

Here is a description of where to mark each height on the figure:

- **Ellipsoidal Height (GPS):**  
  Draw a line from the Earth's surface vertically to the **Ellipsoid**.

- **Orthometric Height (Leveling):**  
  Draw a line from the Earth's surface vertically to the **Geoid**.

- **Geoid Height (Gravity):**  
  Mark the height difference between the **Ellipsoid** and the **Geoid**.

- **Satellite Altimetry:**  
  Mark the height between the **Ocean Surface** and the **Ellipsoid**.
